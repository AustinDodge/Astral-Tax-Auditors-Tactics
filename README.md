# Astral-Tax-Auditors-Tactics

Astral Tax Auditors Tactics is a rogueish turn-based tactical RPG about a team of government accountants who find themselves trapped on a space station where the people are missing, the robots have turned nasty, and the monsters have presumably been nasty the whole time.

It is not complete - it could be described as pre-alpha.

Here's a brief and hastily made pictoral manual that describes the basics of play: https://imgur.com/a/gCalAiB

Even briefer, left-click the suited humans to select them, right-click one of the blue squares that pop up to move to it, and if a monster has red arrows around it, right-click it to attack. Press "return" to watch the enemy monsters do their thing. Press backspace to completely restart everything.
Use the arrow keys to move the view around.

If you can't click on something near the bottom of the screen, use the arrow keys to center the view over it. Currently the detection for interacting with GUI or game elements is very simple, and if the mouse is too low in the screen it'll assume you're trying to click a button.

The executable in folder atat35 is the most stable current version of the game, but there is a definite chance of bugs.
